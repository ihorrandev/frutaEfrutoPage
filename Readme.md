<h1 align=center>Ladding Page Bootstrap<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92957629/179419315-1fed41c0-244b-4df7-a3f9-dece406da7ed.png" width=60px align=center></h1>

<p align=center>My first experience with the Bootstrap framework</p>
<p>This page was developed while I was studying at Alura, I participated in the bootstrap 4 course and in it I made this project more focused on the course. But I hope to use this framework even more, because it is very practical and can genuinely meet all the needs of the front!!</p>

<p>For those who want to know the course, here is my certificate for it, you can access the name of the BOOTSTRAP course I took at Alura:<a href="https://cursos.alura.com.br/certificate/d3153b5c-53d1-4535-9929-303797ba3b66"> certificate link</a></p><br>
<h2 align=center>PROJECT</h2>
<p>The project is basically a landing page that shows revenue from a company that is called fruit and fruit, and the idea is to expand the revenue cycle of that company itself.</p>
